## Generall using
First of all you should know that it's possible to use *PHP-Code* between *HTML-Code*.

Create a **sample.php** file in your directory.

```php
<?php

echo "Hello World!";
```

To use it within your *HTML-Code* simple use


```php
<h1>This is the Headline</h1>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
?>
```
